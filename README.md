🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Detection with EfficientNetB3 + Grad-CAM
Welcome to a deep learning project built to detect and visualize stages of cognitive impairment using MRI image classification powered by EfficientNetB3 and Grad-CAM heatmaps.

💡 This model not only predicts "Mild", "Moderate", "Very Mild", or "No Impairment", but also visually highlights the key regions of the brain MRI contributing to the prediction—giving insights you can trust.

🚀 Key Features
🧠 Multiclass Classification of Alzheimer's disease stages.

⚙️ Built using TensorFlow Keras Functional API for flexibility and Grad-CAM compatibility.

🧰 Utilizes EfficientNetB3, pretrained on ImageNet, for transfer learning.

🔍 Grad-CAM Visualizations with special blue-yellow heatmaps for “No Impairment” cases.

📊 Accuracy, Loss, Time-per-Epoch graphs and Confusion Matrix for evaluation.

📁 Supports image datasets structured by class folders (e.g., Mild Impairment, Moderate Impairment, etc.).

🧪 Automatically generates prediction reports with confidence scores.

💾 Saves trained model and CSV outputs for further analysis.

📂 Dataset Format

train/
├── Mild Impairment/
├── Moderate Impairment/
├── No Impairment/
└── Very Mild Impairment/
Make sure your images are organized in this way before running the model.

🧪 How It Works
Mounts Google Drive to access training data and save model.

Splits dataset into training and testing sets.

Trains EfficientNetB3 with top layers fine-tuned.

Evaluates model and generates:

Classification report

Balanced accuracy score

Confusion matrix heatmap

Training graphs (accuracy, loss, time)

Saves predictions to test_predictions.csv

Grad-CAM Visualization highlights important image regions based on the predicted class.

📈 Training Curves
Automatically plots:

📉 Training vs Validation Accuracy

🔥 Training vs Validation Loss

⏱️ Time per Epoch (performance trend)

🖼️ Grad-CAM Example
Special Grad-CAM visualization uses:

🔵🟡 Blue-yellow heatmap for "No Impairment"

🔴 Red-based heatmaps for other stages

Overlays heatmaps on original MRI scans

🛠 Requirements
Python 3.8+

TensorFlow 2.x

OpenCV

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Google Colab environment (for Google Drive integration)

📌 Usage
Run the project in Google Colab with your dataset in Drive:

python
Copy
Edit
# Set your paths
DATASET_DIR = "/content/drive/MyDrive/train"
MODEL_SAVE_DIR = "/content/drive/MyDrive/models"

# Start training and visualizing
To visualize Grad-CAM:

python
Copy
Edit
visualize_grad_cam_no_red(image_path, model)
🧠 Sample Output
True Label	Predicted Label	Confidence
Very Mild Impairment	Very Mild Impairment	98.74%
Moderate Impairment	Mild Impairment	67.11%
No Impairment	No Impairment	99.13%

(Full results saved to test_predictions.csv)

📬 Future Work
Add GUI/Flask web interface for user upload & diagnosis

Integrate with medical imaging databases

Support DICOM format
